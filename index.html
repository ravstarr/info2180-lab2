                    The landscape of web development is constantly evolving with new technologies and frameworks \
                    emerging each year. As developers, we must stay adaptable and continuously learn to remain \
                    effective in this dynamic field. From the rise of JAMstack architectures to the growing \
                    importance of progressive web apps, the industry continues to push the boundaries of what's \
                    possible on the web.\
                </p>\
                <p>\
                    Additionally, the focus on performance optimization and accessibility has never been stronger. \
                    Users expect websites to load nearly instantaneously and function flawlessly across all devices. \
                    This demand has led to innovations in rendering techniques, asset delivery, and user interface \
                    design. As we look to the future, technologies like WebAssembly and Edge computing are poised \
                    to further transform how we build and deliver web experiences to users around the globe.\

                <h2>CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use Each</h2>\
                <p class="blog-date">September 18, 2024 by Ravaughn Marsh</p>\
                <img src="css-layout.jpg" alt="CSS Layout" class="blog-image-right">\
                <p>\
                    Modern CSS has given developers powerful tools for creating complex layouts. CSS Grid and \
                    Flexbox are two of the most important layout systems, each with distinct strengths. Flexbox \
                    excels at handling one-dimensional layouts - either rows or columns - making it perfect for \
                    navigation bars, form elements, or centering content. Its flexibility in distributing space \
                    makes it invaluable for components that need to adapt to their content.\
                </p>\
                <p>\
                    CSS Grid, on the other hand, is designed for two-dimensional layouts, controlling both rows \
                    and columns simultaneously. This makes it ideal for overall page layouts, image galleries, \
                    or any design that needs to align elements in multiple directions. The ability to name grid \
                    areas and position items precisely gives designers unprecedented control over layout. In practice, \
                    many modern websites use both technologies together - Grid for the macro layout and Flexbox for \
                    component-level arrangements - leveraging the strengths of each system.\
